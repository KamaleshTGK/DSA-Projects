## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder of the algorithm.
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
4. Run:
   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

## 📝 Note

Some files may include helper classes (e.g., Node, Car2) inside the same .java file.
These don’t need to be saved separately — Java will compile them automatically.
