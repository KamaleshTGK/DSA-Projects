# 🔍 Linear Search

Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm.  
It checks each element of the array one by one until the target element is found or the array ends.

---

## ⚡ Algorithm Steps
1. Start from the first element.
2. Compare each element with the target.
3. If found → return index.
4. If end reached and not found → return -1.

---

## ⏱️ Time Complexity
- Best Case: **O(1)** (element at start)
- Worst Case: **O(n)** (element at end or not present)
- Space: **O(1)**

## 📌 Example
Input: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, target = `30`  
Output: `Found at index 2`
